To do:

Currently have working chatroom lobbies.


Remove players when they disconnect from lobby, and not when page changes. 
Use a page change socket emit to set a changing-page property to true, and check for that on disconnect.
I need to be able to rotate through different pages to create this



1.) Rotate through pages
2.) Remove players from lobbies, and delete lobby when 0 players
3.) Make a simple game connectable and playable
4.) Clean up things such as post request to change name, or deleting chat on reload.
- I am going to have to allow reloads when playing wordle, and page cannot reset.

Possibly changing the storing strategy of information to allow for better saving of data.
